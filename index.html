			<h3>Key Impacts</h3>
			<br>
			
			<h2>Establishing the Precedent for Future Presidents</h2>			
			<p>Washington set many important precedents that shaped the executive office. He established the two-term limit for presidents (which became law later with the 22nd Amendment) and created the tradition of delivering an inaugural address. His decision to step down after two terms set a peaceful transfer of power as a standard.
			<br>
			


				<h2>Creation of the Executive Branch</h2>
				<p>Washington oversaw the creation of the executive departments, including the State, Treasury, and War departments. He appointed key figures like Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, whose differing views on government helped form the basis of America's first political parties.</p>

				<br>

				<h2>Neutral Foreign Policy</h2>
				<p>Washington's foreign policy was rooted in neutrality. His Farewell Address urged the country to avoid entangling alliances and remain neutral in foreign conflicts, a principle that influenced U.S. foreign policy for many years.</p>
				<br>


				
				<h2>Formation of National Institutions</h2>
				<p>Washington’s leadership helped create key institutions, including the U.S. Treasury, which laid the groundwork for the nation's economic system. Hamilton's financial plan, which Washington supported, helped establish the national debt, a national bank, and a stable currency system.</p>

			<h3>Key Impacts</h3>
			<br>
			<h2>Legacy of Equality and Justice</h2>			
			<p>

				Lincoln’s commitment to ending slavery and his broader vision of a nation built on the principles of liberty and equality laid the foundation for future civil rights movements. His efforts continue to resonate in the ongoing struggle for racial equality in the U.S.</p>
				
				<h2>Gettysburg Address</h2>
				<p>Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address (1863) is one of the most iconic speeches in American history, reinforcing the principles of equality and democracy. He emphasized that the Civil War was not just about preserving the Union, but also about ensuring that a government “of the people, by the people, for the people” would endure.</p>
				
				<br>

				<h2>Thirteenth Amendment</h2>
				<p>Lincoln’s leadership was crucial in the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, which constitutionally abolished slavery. His moral and political resolve in advocating for this amendment reshaped the social and legal fabric of the nation.</p>
				<br>



				<h2>Preserving the Union</h2>
				<p>Lincoln’s primary goal during the Civil War (1861–1865) was to preserve the Union. Despite immense pressure, he held the nation together through the conflict, navigating political divisions, military challenges, and internal strife. His leadership ensured the survival of the United States as one nation.</p>

			<h3>Key Impacts</h3>

			<br>

			<h2>End of Reconstruction</h2>			
			<p>

				One of the most consequential actions of Hayes’s presidency was his decision to withdraw federal troops from the South, effectively ending Reconstruction. This move came as part of a political compromise after the disputed 1876 election (in which Hayes was declared the winner). The withdrawal of troops marked the end of efforts to enforce civil rights protections in the South, but it also helped bring the nation together after the divisive Civil War era, despite the negative impact on African Americans in the South. </p>

				<br>
			

					<h2>Civil Service Reform</h2>
					<p>Hayes was a strong advocate for civil service reform. He sought to reduce corruption in government by promoting a merit-based system for government jobs, rather than the patronage system that rewarded political loyalty with positions. Hayes initiated reforms that led to the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which made it illegal to fire government workers for political reasons and required job applicants to pass exams. This laid the groundwork for modern civil service practices.</p>

					<br>

					<h2>Foreign Policy</h2>

					<p>Hayes’s foreign policy was relatively passive compared to other presidencies. He supported the construction of a transcontinental railroad and promoted peaceful relations with neighboring countries, but his administration did not focus heavily on international affairs.

					</p>
				
					<br>
				
					<h2>Veterans’ Benefits and Pensions</h2>

					<p>Hayes expanded benefits for Civil War veterans, signing legislation to provide pensions to veterans who had been disabled in service. His focus on veterans' issues reflected his commitment to supporting the men who had fought to preserve the Union.</p>
